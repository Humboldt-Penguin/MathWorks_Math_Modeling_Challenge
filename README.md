# MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge

This was written in 5 hours for the [2021 Mathworks Math Modeling Challenge](https://m3challenge.siam.org/). Problem 3 asked our team to "Develop a model that predicts the optimal placement of cellular towers ('nodes') in a region".

From our executive summary: 

> We created a Python program that maps Subregion C onto a 2-D coordinate system and computes the optimal cell node distribution about the plane for 5,000 nodes using a Monte Carlo simulation. The optimal node distribution was defined as the distribution that best addressed the bandwidth needs of each subregion based on the reception provided by each node.

Our 2020 paper can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lU-62kmYT0kaIXLA6mMnyC7pEPbTilXh/view), although we didn't solve the problem with technical computing. 

We placed in the top 4% of 760+ papers submitted nationally.
