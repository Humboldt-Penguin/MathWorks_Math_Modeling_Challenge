# MathWorks Math Modeling Challenge

This was written in 5 hours for problem 3 of the 2021 Mathworks Math Modeling Challenge ([competition website](https://m3challenge.siam.org/)). 

From our executive summary: 

> We created a Python program that maps Subregion C [residential area] onto a 2-D coordinate system and computes the optimal cell node [i.e. cell tower] distribution about a plane of 5,000 nodes using a Monte Carlo simulation. The optimal node distribution was defined as the distribution that best addressed the bandwidth needs of each subregion based on the reception provided by each node.

Our 2020 paper can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lU-62kmYT0kaIXLA6mMnyC7pEPbTilXh/view), although we didn't solve the problem with technical computing. 

We placed in the top 4% of 760+ papers submitted nationally.
