From our executive summary: 

> We created a Python program that maps Region C [given map of a residential area] onto a 2-D coordinate system and computes the optimal cell node [i.e. cell tower] distribution about a plane of 5,000 nodes using a Monte Carlo simulation. The optimal node distribution was defined as the distribution that best addressed the bandwidth needs of each subregion based on the reception provided by each node.
